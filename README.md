## About marielleloui.github.io
This is a simple website that I have created in order to showcase my web development work. It has an About Me section, a Skills List section, a Portfolio section, and a Contact Me section at the bottom. The palette and the style that I have chosen for this site is a bit more on the playful side, and is meant to show that web development and design can be fun!
